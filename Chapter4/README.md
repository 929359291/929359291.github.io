# 令人难忘的假期  unforgettable holiday


```bash
在中国，我难忘的假期是春节。
因为春节有许多好吃的食物并且春节是一家团聚的日子，
可以和家人一起看电视、娱乐、聊天。
最重要的是春节可以收到一笔红包，
这样我可以用这笔钱买自己喜欢的东西。
所以春节假期是令我难忘的假期。


In China, my unforgettable holiday is the Spring Festival. 
Because the Spring Festival has many delicious foods and the Spring Festival is a day for family reunion, 
you can watch TV, entertain, and chat with your family.
The most important thing is that I can receive a red envelope during the Spring Festival.
so that I can use the money to buy things I like.
So the Spring Festival holiday is an unforgettable holiday for me.
